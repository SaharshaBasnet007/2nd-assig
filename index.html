    <p>The problem isn’t that life is unfair; it’s your broken idea of fairness.<br>
        Take a proper look at that person you fancy but didn’t fancy you back. That’s a complete person. A person with years of experience being someone completely different to you.<br> A real person who interacts with hundreds or thousands of other people every year.
        Now what are the odds that among all that, you’re automatically their first pick for love-of-their-life?<br> Because – what – you exist? Because you feel something for them? That might matter to you, but their decision is not about you.<br>
        Similarly we love to hate our bosses and parents and politicians. Their judgements are unfair. And stupid.<br> Because they don’t agree with me! And they should! Because I am unquestionably the greatest authority on everything ever in the whole world!
        It’s true there are some truly awful authority figures.<br> But they’re not all evil, self-serving monsters trying to line their own pockets and savour your misery. Most are just trying to do their best, under different circumstances to your own.</p>
